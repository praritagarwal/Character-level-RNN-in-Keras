# Character level RNN

Train GRU and LSTM based RNNs to generate complete words/sentences one character at a time. 

Based on Chapter 16 of [hands-on-machine-learning, 2nd Edition](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/) by Aurelion Geron and a similar Udacity excercise for training LSTMs in PyTorch.
